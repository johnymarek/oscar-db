This addon is based on rtmpGUI PC application:
http://forum.wiziwig.eu/threads/58518-rtmpGUI-Official-thread

It allows to watch directly on POHD many rtmp streams from this list
maintained by rtmpGUI users:
http://apps.ohlulz.com/rtmpgui/list.xml

Rtmp-db is a "package" for [PlayOn!X] project made by Mikka
See http://playon.unixstorm.org for more details

It uses SQLite Database, PHP engine and it
needs media-translate (RSS Ex) [PlayOn!X] package pre-installed
See http://code.google.com/p/media-translate/ for the original sources

Live update of the Channlel list (to local Database) from website 
is provided by a menu entry.
The menu also offers search and sorting
Favorite's functionality is implemented by "0" button.

Installation:

Copy the files to HDD  /home/scripts/rtmp-db;
Create the following menu entry:

<item>
<title>RtmpGUI</title>
<link>http://127.0.0.1:82/rtmp-db/index.php</link>
<media>/home/scripts/rtmp-db/images/rtmp.png</media>
</item>

Using a local XML list instead of Online Update:

Copy your XML file structured as per rtmpGUI format to
/home/scripts/rtmp-db/last.xml
The DB update will be taken from it instead of online list.
If you want to syncronize DB to the online list again,
just remove or rename the local file /home/scripts/rtmp-db/last.xml
