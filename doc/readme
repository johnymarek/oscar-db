PHP-RSS-SQLITE experiments on mipsel-based media players 
http://code.google.com/p/oscar-db/

Visit http://www.readonwebtv.com/ for more details about 
their great online service used for this example.

This project is a "package" for [PlayOn!X] project by Mikka
See http://playon.unixstorm.org for more details

It uses SQLite Database, PHP engine and 
needs media-translate (RSS Ex) to work (for now)
See http://code.google.com/p/media-translate/ 

Live update of the Channlel list (to local Database) from website is provided by menu entry.
The menu also offers search and sorting by Country or Genre.
Favorite functionality will be implemented by "0" button.

Installation:

Copy the files to HDD/scripts/oscar-db;
Create two menu entries:

<item>
<title>ReadOnWebTV</title>
<link>http://127.0.0.1:82/oscar-db/index.php</link>
<!-- <media>http://www.readonwebtv.com/itvlogo.png</media> -->
<media>/home/scripts/oscar-db/images/ch3.jpg</media>
</item>

<item>
<title>ReadOnWebRadio</title>
<link>http://127.0.0.1:82/oscar-db/index_a.php</link>
<media>/home/scripts/oscar-db/images/ch6.jpg</media>
</item>

You can also manage the SQLite Database with your PC, by addressing the mediaplayer on local network:
http://<PlayerIP>:82/oscar-db/browser.php  (login admin)
This is based on http://code.google.com/p/phpliteadmin/  project

Please, do not update DB from the web too often as it takes long time and 
loads readonweb servers with extra queries. 
The final stream links are passed through asx files and they could be actualized even without often updating the entire list.  

Keep a copy of DB file in case of some problems when playing with it.
Currently, more than 2500 TV and 4000 Radio Channels are present.
Stream availability strongly depends from your Country/ISP speed and restrictions.
Many of them do not work.
