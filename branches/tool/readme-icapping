Simple way to create and verify an .icapp package (with no link files)* on Win32 machine

Use the provided executables or download and extract them from original distributions:
http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/bzip2.htm
bzip2-1.0.5-bin.zip
From /bin/, take 
bzip2.dll
bzip2.exe

http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/gtar.htm
tar-1.13-1-bin.zip
From /bin/ take
tar.exe
and dependencies: tar-1.13-1-dep.zip
libiconv-2.dll, and libintl-2.dll

Put all files above together with "_make_.bat"  and  "_check_.bat" in same folder.
Create a sub-folder <name> and put inside all files for future icapp package.
Create 2 empty sub-folders named "/out" and "/checked".
To make <name>.icapp
run _make_.bat <name>
The <name>.icapp will be created in "/out" folder.

To check an .icapp package, put in at main folder and run "_check_.bat"
It will be unpacked in "/checked"

* The Unix link files are specific to the OS/filesystem and they could not be 
emulated fully on Win32. However, if the links are betwen files within your 
icapp structure, you can try making cross links with included "ln.exe" tool before icapping.
Works only on NTFS.
